# The Engine Yard Docs

This repo holds all the content (and other bits) for the Engine Yard docs, located at [EY Docs][ey-docs].

The inspiration of this method of documentation came from the awesome guys at [Basho][basho] who have the [Basho Wiki][basho-wiki] setup with Gollum.

We are using [Gollum][gollum] and [Gollum-Site][gol-site] to generate the documentation. Gollum is a great piece of open source software released by the GitHub team that lets you maintain and build wikis from the contents of a Git repo.

`gollum-site` generates html from pages written in any format supported by Gollum (ASCIIDoc, Creole, Markdown, Textile, etc.).

## How to Contribute

Part of the reason we switched to Gollum and GitHub for the EY Docs was to make it easier for people to contribute. Just treat it like a code repo: If you have anything to change or add, simply:

1. [Fork this repo][forking]

2. [Build a local copy][build]

3. Create a new Branch:

        git checkout -b <branch-name>

4. Add your changes

5. Commit changes to your branch

6. [Send us a pull request][pull-req]

If it's a small or obvious change, we're likely to merge it right away.  If we have questions, we'll communicate with you using the pull request's issue page.

The [Gollum README][gol-read] provides a great introduction to using the wiki system.

## Building the Docs Locally

If you want to build and view the EY Docs locally, here is what you need to do:

1. Clone this repo:

        git clone git://github.com/engineyard/ey-docs.git

2. Ensure that you have [Bundler][bundler] installed:

        gem install bundler

3. Install all pre-requisite gems:

        bundle install

4. Generate the site and start a local server (This will take a minute. Don't fret.)

        gollum-site generate   # Will generate the files
        gollum-site serve      # Will start the gollum-site server

5. Navigate to <http://localhost:8000/Home.html> (Default) to access a fully-functional copy of the EY Docs.


## Sanitization

You can customize sanitization with three options:

* --allow_elements: custom elements allowed, comma separated
* --allow_attributes: custom attributes allowed, comma separated
* --allow_protocols: custom protocols in *href* allowed, comma separated

       `$ gollum-site generate --allow_elements embed,object --allow_attributes src --allow_protocols irc`
