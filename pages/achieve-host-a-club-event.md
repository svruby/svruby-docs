# Achievement: Host a Club Event

The host-with-the-most. The master of ceremonies. A club event would flop about in the winds of disorganization without you. Thanks!

## The activity: A Club Event

Without club members coming together at the same time, in the same place, doing/seeing/hearing the same thing we'd be just a mailing list of people who live near each other. Events make our club special.

What makes an event super special is a Host who sequences, threads, and ties all the bits and pieces (perhaps described in an agenda). That's you.

Example events that you might be hosting:

* Meetup with short and long-form talks
* Hack-a-thon or Hack night
* Katas
* Koans
