# Silicon Valley Ruby Club Documentation

The SV Ruby Club is one of the premier Ruby clubs in the world. Our focus is on being a club of people who love Ruby, love creation, and love progressive improvement.

We primarily meetup at Carnegie Mellon University campus in Silicon Valley/Mountain View. Each month we organize at least two club events like featured talks, hands on coding, etc. See [[Activities|activities]] for more detail.

## Board Roles
The SV Ruby Club has many officer roles which can be created on the spot to allow for greater participation. The officer team also meets twice a month because we love our club and love progressive improvement.

* VP Advertising Officer

## Achievements
We "run" our club via achievements rather than process or rules. Members and guests are rewarded for participation and improvement. Examples of club achievements are [[First Visit|achieve-first-visit]] for new guests, [[Share Something Shiny|achieve-share-something-shiny]] for showing off something new, and [[Host a Club Event|achieve-host-a-club-event]] for leading a club event and ensuring everyone has a fabulous time.

There is no wrong way for our club to exist. Yet we each want something from the club - to learn about Ruby and programming, to have companionship, to have leadership, to have purpose, and above all to know that participating in the club was more valuable than any alternative like watching TV or playing World of Warcraft.

Instead of "process" or "rules" we "run" our club by celebrating achievements. If you visit a meeting for the first time then that is a wonderful thing. If you take the opportunity to orchestrate and organize a club event then 20-100 people will have a wonderful experience. That is truly an achievement, and we thank you.

Our club documentation describes these achievements. We hope that if everyone is striving to perform these achievements, and if we celebrate them, then our club will be wonderful, purposeful and have a long life. 

More importantly, the club will be well-worth joining, enjoying and sharing.

## About the Documentation

Documentation of the SV Ruby Club is written in the tense of Achievements rather than Process. For example, it is an Achievement to [[Host a Club Event|achieve-host-a-club-event]]. The description of this Achievement includes the Process for running a club as a template. The documentation of our club is written from the perspective but it is more important that someone did "Run a club meetup" than how it was run.

Participation and progress are more important than Process and Policy.

As each member performs Achievements, they in turn receive Awards/Badges. Each Award they receive represents personal improvement and progressive achievement.
